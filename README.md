## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

Semi transparent patterns in the background are a pain in the ass to see, especially on mobile.
So far the only way I was able to see the bottom pattern on mobile was by using IrfanView Image -> Negative (invert image) -> All channels.
Hope it helps anyone else who's had the same issue as me.

### Continued development

Finding new ways of seeing those semy transparent background patterns.. oh and improving my CSS skills, wasn't satisfied with the results of this project.
